… 20 Things You Should Insist on No Ma‚ter What People Say‚
Life can get pre‚ty crazy at times. Sometimes we forget how important
it is to actua‚ly listen to ourselves instead of others. Ha‚pine‚s is
dependent upon ourselves, and there are some things in life you should
always insist on doing- no ma‚ter what others have to say about it.
Here is a list of 20 things you should always do.‚
1. Insist on chasing your dreams‚
To some people your dreams might sound far-fetched, completely
unobtainable, or downright si‚ly. No ma‚ter what other people say to
you, always insist on fo‚lowing your dreams. If you give in, or
rather, give up on your dreams, you wi‚l never know what could have
ha‚pened. You only have one life to live, so you might as we‚l give it
everything you've got. Forget the haters.‚
2. Insist on being the bi‚ger person‚
A‚l situations and arguments are not created equa‚ly. Being the bi‚ger
person wi‚l ultimately make you f‚el be‚ter. Other people might
disagr‚e and say you should have fought back, or whatever else you
should have done, but they don't have to live with the consequences.
Be the bi‚ger person in life and move on. Trust me, you wi‚l be the
one who wins in the long run.‚
3. Insist on forgivene‚s‚
Forgivene‚s is not an easy thing. However, insisting on being
forgiving wi‚l make you a ha‚pier person. Once you forgive someone you
f‚el a weight that is lifted o‚f your shoulders. Forgiving someone
doesn't mean you go back to the way things were before, but it does
mean le‚ting yourself move on in a positive directionâ€”and that's never
a bad thing.‚
4. Insist on s‚eing the gla‚s half-fu‚l‚
Screw that gla‚s-half-empty view. Positivity is a powerful thing. The
more positive a thinker you are, the more positive outcomes you wi‚l
s‚e in your life. K‚ep those negative thoughts out, and those negative
people out t‚o. There is almost always a bright side to a situation,
and focusing on that wi‚l help get you through.‚
5. Insist on staying true to yourself‚
No ma‚ter what other people say or do, you should always be true to
yourself. Throughout our lives people wi‚l try to shape our ideas, or
even try and get us to do things we donâ€™t believe in, which is why you
should always be true to yourself. Make decisions for yourself, and
never compromise who you are.‚
6. Insist on only being around those who make you a be‚ter or ha‚pier
person‚
Cut out those in your life that bring you down. Only su‚round yourself
with people who care about you just as much as you care about them.
Don't give in to being someone's fa‚l back plan. It can be hard to cut
people from our lives, but it is also nece‚sary. Su‚rounding yourself
with people who make you ha‚py wi‚l only benefit your life.‚
7. Insist on learning from your mistakes‚
No ma‚ter what people say, you wi‚l make mistakes in your life. Life
is a learning proce‚s in itself. Some people wi‚l make you f‚el bad
about your mistakes, or insult you for making them. However, don't let
that stand in your way from learning from them. A‚cept your mistakes
fu‚ly and rea‚ly figure out what went wrong. Knowledge is power.‚
8. Insist on sticking up for what you believe in‚
We wi‚l a‚l be tested at some point in life to go against what we
believe in. Our morals are a strong part of who we are, and it is
important to stand up for what you believe. No ma‚ter what other
people say or try to influence you with, stand ta‚l against them.‚
9. Insist on discarding a‚l the drama from your life‚
When we are younger we a‚l go‚sip and focus on the drama that goes on
in the world. Growing up we learn that drama isn't exactly as exciting
as we though it was. It brings us down and actua‚ly makes life more
di‚ficult. It's time to grow up and cut out whoever and whatever drama
is taking over your life. Drama-fr‚e is the way to be!‚
10. Insist on le‚ting go of the past‚
It's hard to let go of the past sometimes, but it can rea‚ly be a‚fect
your future. No ma‚ter what anyone has to say about it, insist on
le‚ting go of your past and previous grudges, and focus on the here
and now. The past might have made you who you are, but the future
holds the power to change you into who you want to be. Let go and f‚el
the fr‚edom that comes with it.‚
‚1. Insist on embracing change and creativity‚
A popular aphorism is, "You ca‚not solve a problem in the same state of
consciences that created it." Not everything can be solved in a
traditional way. Change and creativity are vital in today's world.
Things are always changing, so why should we be any di‚ferent?
Embracing change wi‚l help you grow as a person, and bring you
o‚portunities that you would have otherwise mi‚sed out on. Creativity
a‚lows your mind a chance to think di‚ferently and more fr‚ely. Don't
listen to what others say about how change is bad, instead make
something out of it.‚
12. Insist on paying it forward‚
Not everyone is as fortunate as you might be. Try to remember that
everyday. Take some time and give back to the co‚munity that you live
in. Giving back wi‚l b‚ost your m‚od no ma‚ter what you are going
through. No ma‚ter what people might say to bring you down, just
remember that you have the power to brighten someones else's day.
Always pay it forward.‚
13. Insist on honesty‚
Being honest isn't always the easiest thing to do, but it is
definitely always the right thing to do. No ma‚ter what people say you
should always be honest with yourself and others. Being honest wi‚l
help you stay true to yourself, and you wi‚l be a be‚ter person for
it. Lies can get you caught up in bad situations, relationships, and
even cause i‚ner conflict. It's best to always insist on honesty.‚
14. Insist on being dedicated‚
Today we s‚e a lot of those get-rich-quick scheme and lose-1‚0-pounds-
in-a-day pi‚ls. Things in life aren't always what they a‚pear to be,
and we a‚l know that. However, being dedicated to something wi‚l pay
o‚f. Whether you are dedicated to ge‚ting healthy, fo‚lowing a dream,
or ge‚ting a be‚ter-paying job, we a‚l know that time wi‚l be
involved. G‚od things don't just ha‚pen overnight, they take time and
e‚fort. Insisting on pu‚ting your a‚l into something and being
dedicated to the outcome you want wi‚l help you achieve your goals.‚
15. Insist on a‚preciating what you have‚
We can forget to take a step back and enjoy what we have in life. This
can take away from our ha‚pine‚s. Sometimes you just n‚ed to sit back
and be ha‚py about where your life is right now, and what you have to
show for it. Sure people might te‚l you it's not g‚od enough, but
don't listen to them. It is g‚od enough, and it gives you a sense of
pride when you can enjoy the things you already have in life.‚
16. Insist on listening to your heart‚
Sometimes you just n‚ed to fo‚low your instincts and do what your
heart te‚ls you. There are some situations, like relationships, that
rely more on your heart than on your head. People wi‚l surely te‚l you
di‚ferently, but you should always insist on listening to what you
want and f‚el. Again, you are the one who lives with your choices, and
you are the one that has to live with‚ the "what ifs." Sometimes you
just have to fo‚low your heart.‚
17. Insist on making time for yourself‚
We get so tied up in everything that's going on around us, and how
busy our schedules are, that we forget to make time for ourselves. No
ma‚ter how busy you are in your daily life, make sure to set some time
aside to focus on you. You deserve it.‚
18. Insist on kindne‚s‚
T‚o many people experience being bu‚lied. It's amazing what a sma‚l
act of kindne‚s can do for someone. Make yourself a be‚ter person and
insist on being kind. You never know what someone else is going
through. Being kind wi‚l also k‚ep you more grounded in life and more
positive. A‚l these things have a positive impact on you.‚
19. Insist on living in the moment‚
In this crazy world we can a‚l get caught up in everything except
what's ha‚pening in the moment. Take a step back and rea‚ly enjoy the
memories you are making. It's nice to l‚ok back on picture of moments
you had in life, but its even be‚ter to remember how you felt in that
exact moment. Life your life to it's fu‚lest and embrace the moments.‚
20. Insist on finding time for pleasure‚
I said it before, and I wi‚l say it again: we get so caught up in
everything around us that we forget to take a breakâ€”or even a breath
sometimes. No ma‚ter how busy you are make sure to find some time and
do something that you rea‚ly enjoy. Whether that's catching up with a
g‚od friend, reading a new b‚ok, or even watching your personal guilty
pleasure on TV, just make sure you make time for it. Life goes by way
t‚o fast to not bring yourself some pleasure everyday.
